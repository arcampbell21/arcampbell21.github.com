One of my biggest passions in life is riding motorcycles. Over 3 years ago I started off with a Kawasaki Ninja 250R, a small bike to learn on and see if I liked riding. Now my skills are built up and I've moved to a <p class="none">Honda CBR600RR</p> This bike is much less forgiving being a 600cc SuperSport with hardened suspension, more agressive riding position, and high-performance brakes.

<h3>Berners-Lee was essentially the founding father of the web, being the main developer of HTML, HTTP, and finally publishing the
     world's first website, <a href="info.cern.ch">info.cern.ch</a>. Source: <a href="https://www.history.com/news/the-worlds-first-web-site">History.com</a>

    In order to secure a domain name of your own, there are costs involved. ICANN has their own fees for each domain, but the real determination
    of price is popularity. For example, something like "acam89302.com" is going to be very cheap, $8-10, because it's just difficult and non-intuitive.
    However, domains like "amazon.com" go for thousands to hundreds of millions of dollars. Even sites like "amzn.com" go for those prices as well, purely
    because they are so similar to the real domain, they will be clicked often. Source: <a href=https://fortunly.com/blog/the-most-expensive-domain-names-ever-sold/#gref">Fortunly.com</a>

    HTML, despite it's simplicity, is the backbone to all webpages, and more advanced languages like CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, etc. would all be non-existent
    without having the structure of HTML. I find it interesting that such a simple language is still used so extensively, with nothing really replacing it, yet.
